### Monitorizare Vot

A digital tool for election monitoring. It has three main parts: 

- a [public platform](https://monitorizarevot.ro/) where anyone can read the voting rules and report if they notice anything that goes against the voting rules 
- native apps for both Android and iOS allowing observers to send real-time reports from the field
- admin platform for NGOs that register election observers

After the latest elections, we realized we need to enhance the platform with new functionalities, so right now we are focusing on:

- enhancements on [NGO platform](https://github.com/code4romania/monitorizare-vot-ong/issues) for the next set of elections coming in November - the features we are looking at implementing are importing polling station information, observer management, forms management and reporting
- a new [admin dashboard](https://github.com/code4romania/monitorizare-vot-votanti-client/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Amay-release) for the public platform that will allow admins to easily update the website info (voting rules, report form) and approve or reject reports sent by users
- setting up some [manual](https://github.com/code4romania/monitorizare-vot-android/labels/testing) and automated tests for the apps and APIs

**Tech stack**:

- public platform: [PHP](https://github.com/code4romania/monitorizare-vot-votanti-api/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aphp) (Laravel 5) for the API, [React](https://github.com/code4romania/monitorizare-vot-votanti-admin/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Areact) on frontend
- NGO admin platform: [.NET Core API](https://github.com/code4romania/monitorizare-vot-ong) and [Angular 2](https://github.com/code4romania/monitorizare-vot-ong) frontend

### Catalog politic - Declaratii de avere

Catalog Politic - Asset declarations is a crowd sourcing and volunteer aid app for digitizing asset declarations of Romania's public figures. This tool aims to provide an easy and simple way to transform asset declarations from a pdf format to a consistent data model that can be analyzed and interpreted, while opening this information to a larger audience.

We are currently working on:

- Docker-izing Catalog Politic - Digitalizare Declarații (which includes the web application used for digitalization and PyBossa)
- autoamtic deployment using Travis CI and AWS
- creating automated tests
- testing the workflow, manually, to ensure it works end to end and to get feedback on ways to improve on it

### ANABI - Portalul Bunurilor Confiscate
ANABI - Portalul bunurilor confiscate Dezvoltăm pentru Agenția Națională pentru Administrarea Bunurilor Indisponibilizate (ANABI) o platformă despre ce, cât și de unde se confiscă în România, din infracțiuni. Punem totul pe hartă, pentru ca tu să știi ce se petrece. ANABI va folosi platforma pentru a gestiona aceste bunuri la nivel național, inclusiv re-directionarea acestor resurse. Astfel, platforma va transparentiza procesul de utilizare a bunurilor confiscate.

### Centru Civic

The project aims to turn into the public library of Romanian civic tech.

- There are some [API defects](https://github.com/code4romania/civichq-api/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Abug) that hinder the current deployment and need urgent atention.
- We also have some new designs for the site. We have some [Front end](https://github.com/code4romania/civichq-client/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Afront-end) issues and [Research](https://github.com/code4romania/civichq-client/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3AResearch) tasks and also some small API development issues. 
- We would also like to set up some automated tests for the API so we have some open [testing](https://github.com/code4romania/civichq-api/labels/testing) tasks as well.
- Another step for improving the solution is to provide a [Dockerfile](https://github.com/code4romania/civichq-api/issues/68) for running this solution as a standalone container.

**Tech stack**: [Express.js](https://github.com/code4romania/civichq-api/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aespress-js+project%3Acode4romania%2F8), [Angular 7](https://github.com/code4romania/civichq-client/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3Aangular+project%3Acode4romania%2F8)

### RVM - Resource & Volunteer Management

RVM is a technical solution that will serve the Department for Emergency Situations in case of any natural or accidental crisis situation, allowing them to keep track of CSO resource stock and volunteering capacity at any given moment in time. The solution will cut down bureaucracy, human error and both human and time resource waste on logistical aspects of maintaining such a database up to date and make use of it in times of distress.

The project has 3 modules:
- An API that will serve both the web client and the mobile application
- A web application client, that will be used by administrators and NGOs
- A mobile application, used by DSU agents
Wireframes for the solution can be found here:
