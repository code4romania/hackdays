### Catalog politic - Declaratii de avere

Catalog Politic - Asset declarations is a crowd sourcing and volunteer aid app for digitizing asset declarations of Romania's public figures. This tool aims to provide an easy and simple way to transform asset declarations from a pdf format to a consistent data model that can be analyzed and interpreted, while opening this information to a larger audience.

We are currently working on:

- Docker-izing Catalog Politic - Digitalizare Declarații (which includes the web application used for digitalization and PyBossa)
- automatic deployment using Travis CI and AWS
- creating automated tests
- testing the workflow, manually, to ensure it works end to end and to get feedback on ways to improve on it

### Rezultate Vot

The project aims to be an aggregator for election information in Romania. The project will contain historic information for elections in Romania, will contain real time results for each election, as it will parse results published by BEC (Biroul Electoral Central) and it will also contain information about the budgets spent during the electoral campaign.

Currently our focus is on:
- [importing historic results](https://github.com/code4romania/rezultate-vot/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Ahistoric-results) of elections 
- being prepared for providing [live results](https://github.com/code4romania/rezultate-vot/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Avote-results) during the counting of the next round of elections.

### Seismic Risc

Let's save lives together!

Seismic Risc aims to become an aggregator of seismic data and building analysis, currently focusing on data in Bucharest, but looking towards expading for the whole country.

Currently we are focusing on:
- building a [map](https://github.com/code4romania/seismic-risc/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Amap) that displays information about buildings and their classification
- a simple [CMS](https://github.com/code4romania/seismic-risc/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Acms) to be able, as an admin of the platform, to insert data, validate user inputs

**Tech stack**: [Python/Django](https://github.com/code4romania/seismic-risc/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Adjango)

### Expert Consultation App

Expert Consultation App is a digital tool to allow groups of experts to work directly on the text of law proposals, to contribute feedback, suggestions, comments, vote and amend certain proposals, articles or comments of other participants etc. and then automatically reinforce the final document. This tool will make it easier to consult experts with enough time to give everyone an opinion, eliminating unnecessary bureaucracy and allowing real-time access to the same information for thousands of people who otherwise would only interact with a single contact point.

Wireframes for the project can be found here:

### Data Portal

Data Portal will be a CKAN-based user-friendly web application meant to showcase curated data sets in simple and intuitive visual designs. It will also put forward standards and guidelines for cleaning and organizing data. The portal will be open to any NGO and institution that works with public data and our team will be there to help them validate and bring the information up to standards.

Last but not least. The app will serve as a base for developing Romania’s open data community: we will make our infrastructure and know-how available to volunteers interested in opening up and cleaning Romanian public data.

We are currently working on:

- implementing platform [UI](https://github.com/code4romania/ckanext-dataportaltheme/issues)
- a  [github extension](https://github.com/code4romania/ckanext-githubfeed/issues) to bring the latest issues into DataPortal
- a  [Medium extension](https://github.com/code4romania/ckanext-mediumfeed/issues) to bring all Medium posts into DataPortal


**Tech stack**:

- (backend) CKAN 2.8 Platform: Python 2.7
- (frontend) CKAN 2.8 Templating engine: HTML, Javascript and CSS
