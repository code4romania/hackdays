# Hackday#2 - 23 Februarie 2019

## Proiecte:

### ANABI - Portalul Bunurilor Confiscate
ANABI - Portalul bunurilor confiscate Dezvoltăm pentru Agenția Națională pentru Administrarea Bunurilor Indisponibilizate (ANABI) o platformă despre ce, cât și de unde se confiscă în România, din infracțiuni. Punem totul pe hartă, pentru ca tu să știi ce se petrece. ANABI va folosi platforma pentru a gestiona aceste bunuri la nivel național, inclusiv re-directionarea acestor resurse. Astfel, platforma va transparentiza procesul de utilizare a bunurilor confiscate.

### Data Portal

Data Portal will be a CKAN-based user-friendly web application meant to showcase curated data sets in simple and intuitive visual designs. It will also put forward standards and guidelines for cleaning and organizing data. The portal will be open to any NGO and institution that works with public data and our team will be there to help them validate and bring the information up to standards.

Last but not least. The app will serve as a base for developing Romania’s open data community: we will make our infrastructure and know-how available to volunteers interested in opening up and cleaning Romanian public data.

### Monitorizare Vot

A digital tool for election monitoring. It has three main parts: 

- a [public platform](https://monitorizarevot.ro/) where anyone can read the voting rules and report if they notice anything that goes against the voting rules 
- native apps for both Android and iOS allowing observers to send real-time reports from the field
- admin platform for NGOs that register election observers

We are currently working on:

- small [fixes](https://github.com/code4romania/monitorizare-vot-android/issues/113) and [improvements](https://github.com/code4romania/monitorizare-vot-android/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aenhancement+project%3Acode4romania%2F7) for the Android app
- a new admin dashboard for the public platform that will allow admins to easily update the website info (voting rules, report form) and approve or reject reports sent by users

**Tech stack**:

- public platform: [PHP](https://github.com/code4romania/monitorizare-vot-votanti-api/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aphp) (Laravel 5) for the API, [React](https://github.com/code4romania/monitorizare-vot-votanti-admin/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Areact) on frontend
- mobile apps: Java (Android), Swift; backed by a .Net Core API
- NGO admin platform: .Net Core API and Angular 2 frontend
