# Repository to handle general information about Code4Romania Hackdays

We are the ones we've been waiting for!

Welcome! Since you're here, you must be a kind soul, willing to donate your time and skills to [Code for Romania](https://code4.ro/en/).

We've been organizing HackDays for a while now. They are monthly events which unfold, simultaneously, in Bucharest, Iași, Timișoara and Cluj. A HackDay event is 12 hours long, and it occurs, as a general rule, during the last Saturday of each month. These events are part of our Tech for Social Good program.

HackDays are straightforward events! The ongoing projects list all the current Issues which require volunteer help on their respective GitHub project boards. All Issues are graded based on difficulty. Both experimented developers and beginners who are dabbling in a new language or framework can find something to work on. The tasks are intended to only take up a few hours of work at most. Any questions should be directed to the Code for Romanian tech team members. 

Below you can find all the information you need in order to start contributing right away!
