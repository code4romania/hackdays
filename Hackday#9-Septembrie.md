### Monitorizare Vot

A digital tool for election monitoring. It has three main parts: 

- a [public platform](https://monitorizarevot.ro/) where anyone can read the voting rules and report if they notice anything that goes against the voting rules 
- native apps for both Android and iOS allowing observers to send real-time reports from the polling stations
- admin platform for NGOs that register election observers, create election monitoring forms and send real-time notifications to observers

After the latest elections, we realized we need to enhance the platform with new functionalities, so right now we are focusing on:

- enhancements on [NGO platform](https://github.com/code4romania/monitorizare-vot-ong/issues) for the next set of elections coming in November - the features we are looking at implementing are importing polling station information, observer management, forms management, push notifications
- update the iOS application with a new UX/UI and re-write the [Android application from scratch in Kotlin](https://github.com/code4romania/mon-vot-android-kotlin/issues)
- a new [admin dashboard](https://github.com/code4romania/monitorizare-vot-votanti-client/issues) for the public platform that will allow admins to easily update the website info (voting rules, report form) and approve or reject reports sent by users
- setting up some [manual](https://github.com/code4romania/monitorizare-vot-android/labels/testing) and automated tests for the apps and APIs
- improve both the codebase and the UX of the mobile apps, for this we have some [research tasks](https://github.com/code4romania/monitorizare-vot-android/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aresearch)

**Tech stack**:

- public platform: [PHP/Laravel 5](https://github.com/code4romania/monitorizare-vot-votanti-api/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aphp) for the API, [React](https://github.com/code4romania/monitorizare-vot-votanti-admin/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Areact) on frontend
- NGO admin platform: [.NET Core API](https://github.com/code4romania/monitorizare-vot-ong/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Adotnet) and [Angular 5](https://github.com/code4romania/monitorizare-vot-ong/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aangular) frontend
- mobile applications: [Kotlin](https://github.com/code4romania/mon-vot-android-kotlin/issues) and [Swift 5](https://github.com/code4romania/monitorizare-vot-ios/issues)

### Catalog Politic - website

Catalog Politic aims to become the first aggregator of political figures profiles.

Information about political figures is highly dispared, the public accessible data can be found in many sources. Many of them are unknown to the public or simply too hard to find. The aim of the project is to make this data transparent, so that any information can be easily accessible.

Currently, the project has 2 main parts:
- the website, that will display the profiles of political figures, and that currently focuses on displaying the profiles of presidential elections candidates, and that uses the [GatsbyJS static website framework](https://github.com/code4romania/catalog-politic/issues)
- a [form](https://github.com/code4romania/catalog-politic-form/issues), built using React, where we will be able to insert meaningful information about profiles, that will be able to persist data to a DynamoDB instance

**Tech stack**: [GatsbyJS](https://github.com/code4romania/catalog-politic/issues)

### Rezultate Vot

The project aims to be an aggregator for election information in Romania. The project will contain historic information for elections in Romania, will contain real time results for each election, as it will parse results published by BEC (Biroul Electoral Central) and it will also contain information about the budgets spent during the electoral campaign.

Currently our focus is on:
- [importing historic results](https://github.com/code4romania/rezultate-vot/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Ahistoric-results) of elections 
- being prepared for providing [live results](https://github.com/code4romania/rezultate-vot/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Avote-results) during the counting of the next round of elections.

### Seismic Risc

Let's save lives together!

Seisimic Risc aims to become an aggregator of seismic data and building analysis, currently focusing on data in Bucharest, but looking towards expading for the whole country.

Currently we are focusing on:
- building a [map](https://github.com/code4romania/seismic-risc/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Amap) that displays information about buildings and their classification
- a simple [CMS](https://github.com/code4romania/seismic-risc/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Acms) to be able, as an admin of the platform, to insert data, validate user inputs

**Tech stack**: [Python/Django](https://github.com/code4romania/seismic-risc/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Adjango)

### Catalog politic - Declaratii de avere

Catalog Politic - Asset declarations is a crowd sourcing and volunteer aid app for digitizing asset declarations of Romania's public figures. This tool aims to provide an easy and simple way to transform asset declarations from a pdf format to a consistent data model that can be analyzed and interpreted, while opening this information to a larger audience.

We are currently working on:

- Docker-izing Catalog Politic - Digitalizare Declarații (which includes the web application used for digitalization and PyBossa)
- autoamtic deployment using Travis CI and AWS
- creating automated tests
- testing the workflow, manually, to ensure it works end to end and to get feedback on ways to improve on it

### ANABI - Portalul Bunurilor Confiscate

ANABI - Portalul bunurilor confiscate Dezvoltăm pentru Agenția Națională pentru Administrarea Bunurilor Indisponibilizate (ANABI) o platformă despre ce, cât și de unde se confiscă în România, din infracțiuni. Punem totul pe hartă, pentru ca tu să știi ce se petrece. ANABI va folosi platforma pentru a gestiona aceste bunuri la nivel național, inclusiv re-directionarea acestor resurse. Astfel, platforma va transparentiza procesul de utilizare a bunurilor confiscate.

### Legal Consultation App

Legal Consultation App is a digital tool to allow groups of experts to work directly on the text of law proposals, to contribute feedback, suggestions, comments, vote and amend certain proposals, articles or comments of other participants etc. and then automatically reinforce the final document. This tool will make it easier to consult experts with enough time to give everyone an opinion, eliminating unnecessary bureaucracy and allowing real-time access to the same information for thousands of people who otherwise would only interact with a single contact point.

### Centru Civic

The project aims to turn into the public library of Romanian civic tech.

- There are some [API defects](https://github.com/code4romania/civichq-api/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Abug) that hinder the current deployment and need urgent atention.
- We also have some new designs for the site. We have some [Front end](https://github.com/code4romania/civichq-client/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Afront-end) issues and [Research](https://github.com/code4romania/civichq-client/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3AResearch) tasks and also some small API development issues. 
- We would also like to set up some automated tests for the API so we have some open [testing](https://github.com/code4romania/civichq-api/labels/testing) tasks as well.
- Another step for improving the solution is to provide a [Dockerfile](https://github.com/code4romania/civichq-api/issues/68) for running this solution as a standalone container.

**Tech stack**: [Express.js](https://github.com/code4romania/civichq-api/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aespress-js+project%3Acode4romania%2F8), [Angular 7](https://github.com/code4romania/civichq-client/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3Aangular+project%3Acode4romania%2F8)
